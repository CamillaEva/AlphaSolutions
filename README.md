# Alpha Solutions 

this application designed to manage projects and divide them into subProjects and then dividing the subprojects into smaller tasks. In the application you can also set a time estimate on the task, and it will then add it up, so you can see how many hours the project is estimated in total.
Then the employee can see which task they're assigned to and when they are done they can put in how many hours they actually used on the given task, and the project leader will then be able to se how many hours was used in total on the whole project.
